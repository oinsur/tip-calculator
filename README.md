## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

With this challenge I was able to practice working with JavaScript along with HTML & CSS. I also learned how to integrate a dark mode and light mode button to switch between themes.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn about how to use JavaScript to make functional web layouts. I would like to continue to learn about how to use functions and also the DOM with event listeners.

### Useful resources

- [HTML DOM Events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp) - This resource helped me learn about some of the different event listeners that can be used in the DOM.
- [EventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener) - This was another resource that helped me learn about how to use event listeners in the DOM.
